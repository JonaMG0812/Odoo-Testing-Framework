## Some nice hard coded dependencies.
## This project  assumes the following points:
- The working directory is C:\Academy
- There's a Webdrivers directory called 'drivers' with at least chromedriver.exe (check your browser version to maintain compatibility)
- The working directory contains 'selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar

## P.D. Check the testing URL.
